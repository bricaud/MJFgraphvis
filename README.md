# MJFgraphvis: graph visualization with D3.js

The HTML files contains Javascript code to visualize a graph together with meta-data associated to the nodes. The program uses:
* the D3.js library to visualize a graph in an interactive manner
* an ajax request that query a graph database (Neo4j) to get the nodes to be shown
* an access to a JSON file containing the metadata of the nodes.
* Jupyter notebooks to pre-process the meta-data, to be readable with Javascript (to create the JSON files).

The json file is not given.
